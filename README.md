# IKFergusonSayHello

Isaiah Keith Ferguson:

This app. will ask the user their name.

Peer Review: Brandon Le - The program worked as intended. I was able to type in my name and also just random names as I played it again and had no errors. I liked how he had different messages for if people were to input a number ("yea.... that aint it buddy. try again.") and for special characters ("Unless your the product of Elon Musk and Grimes or Prince, I don't think that's your name.") I thought the reference to Elon was funny and creative. There's a few minor spelling errors, but that's A-Okay.  Very good job :)
